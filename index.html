    <h1>HOME</h1>
    <p>Fully stocked supermarket with a wide range of edibles that caters for different nationalities, not only for locals </p>
    <p>An easy to access supermarket thats compact but has a wide variety of good local staple's as well as imported brands. Security, reliability of safe goods and ease of shoping are well worth the reasonable markup in some prices. </p>
    <P> It's a full fledged supermarket, have good stock of chocolates, cheeses, bodycare products etc</P>
    <P>The supermarket has a variety of products to shop like food stuff, cleaning materials, kitchen utensils, and many more.
        The place is really great! </P>
        <P> for your domestic and commercial needs. Just try it for groceries, kitchenware, toiletries, stationery among others. Brandie accepts noncash payments as well such as VisaCard and MasterCardGreat location for food, dog food, toiletries ect. One thing I find odd is the amount of staff they have, almost to the point of more staff wandering around then customers. </P>
        <p>We are located in muyenga opposite </p>
